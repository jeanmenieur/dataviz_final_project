The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course in Fall 2020.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find a brief exploration of some interesting facts about the birth tendencies through periods of time, using the U.S. births data from 2000 until 2014.

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the locations, growth and development of EVs charging stations, through visualizations. This is because I wanted to focus on one of the main concerns of Electric Vehicles (EVs): where to charge them. Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored the distribution of maximum temperatures in the city of Tampa, based on weather station at the TPA facility, through different visualizations.

### Moving Forward

The data visualization course had gave me technical, practical and aesthetical tools to plot data into great visuals effectively. But more than that, it had taught me to show stories through visuals that can give precise and timely information to receptors.

After learning and exploring how to manage amounts and proportions, implement design rules, make interactive plots and manage visualization projects effectively, I am captable of making storytelling visuals and implement them in projects related to my education and my professional work.

In a short-run future, I will implement the graphing tools I learned with data that I have or get. Everytime I need to have a very customized visual to achieve my storytelling goals, I will use R Studio and packages that I've learned to have those visuals.

In a medium-term future, I'm willing to learn more about how to manage and wrangle big data with R or other programming tool to sucessfully condition the data to plot effectively charts.
